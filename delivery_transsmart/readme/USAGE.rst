When the module is setup succesfully, some support data will be fetched from
Transsmart's environment and the module will be ready for usage. As an end user
the two functionalities that are available to you are "get rate" and
"create document".

What get rate does is for a single delivery order you can ask Transsmart for
rates. Transsmart will return a couple of rates/offers from companies for your
picking and what we do is fetch the lowest rate of all the rates and save it on
the Delivery Cost field. You can fetch rates by clicking the Get Rates button
on the stock picking.

What create document does is taking the values of the stock picking and
creating the picking in transsmart's server.
