This module automates the delivery price handling for the following cases:

* If you change any line in your draft sales order (SO), when saving, the
  delivery price will be adjusted without having to click on "â†’ Set price".
* If specified in the system parameter, the delivery line can be also
  auto-added when creating/saving.
* If you deliver a different quantity than the ordered one, the delivery price
  is adjusted on the linked SO when the picking is transferred.

Configuration
=============

* Activate developer mode.
* Go to *Settings > Technical > Parameters > System Parameters*.
* Locate the setting with key "delivery_auto_refresh.auto_add_delivery_line"
  or create a new one if not exists.
  Put a non Falsy value (1, True...) if you want to add automatically the
  delivery line on save.
* Locate the setting with key "delivery_auto_refresh.refresh_after_picking"
  or create a new one if not exists.
  Put a non Falsy value (1, True...) if you want to refresh delivery price
  after transferring.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* After confirming the sales order, the price of the delivery line (if exists)
  will be only updated after the picking is transferred, but not when you
  might modify the order lines.
* There can be some duplicate delivery unset/set for assuring that the refresh
  is done on all cases.
* On multiple deliveries, second and successive pickings update the delivery
  price, but you can't invoice the new delivery price.
* This is only working from user interface, as there's no way of making
  compatible the auto-refresh intercepting create/write methods from sale order
  lines.
