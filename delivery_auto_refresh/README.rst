This module automates the delivery price handling for the following cases:

* If you change any line in your draft sales order (SO), when saving, the
  delivery price will be adjusted without having to click on "→ Set price".
* If specified in the system parameter, the delivery line can be also
  auto-added when creating/saving.
* If you deliver a different quantity than the ordered one, the delivery price
  is adjusted on the linked SO when the picking is transferred.

Configuration
=============

Go to *Settings > Sales > Shipping*:

* Enable "Set default shipping method automalically" if you want to add
  automatically the carrier on the sales quotation creation.
* Enable "Refresh shipping cost line automatically" if you want to add automatically the
  delivery line on save and refresh the cost. This will also set the shipping method.
* Enable "Refresh After Picking Automatically" if you want to refresh delivery
  price after delivering based on what has been delivered.
* Enable "Void delivery lines automatically" if you want to void the delivery
  line values (price, units ordered, units delivered) in the sale order when
  the delivery is returned to refund prior to be invoiced.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* After confirming the sales order, the price of the delivery line (if exists)
  will be only updated after the picking is transferred, but not when you
  might modify the order lines.
* On multiple deliveries, second and successive pickings update the delivery
  price, but you can't invoice the new delivery price.
