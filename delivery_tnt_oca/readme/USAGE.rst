You have to set the created shipping method in the delivery order to ship:

* When the picking is 'Transferred', a *Create Shipping Label* button appears. Just click on it, and if all went well, the label will be 'attached'.
* If the shipment creation process fails, a validation error will appear displaying TNT error.
* A periodical state check will be done querying TNT services.
