To start using GLS, you need to go to Delivery Methods, and create or use
a delivery method with "GLS" as delivery type.
This makes the "configuration" panel available to "system settings" users.
There, there are two types of settings, connection settings and sender.
The connection settings simply manage how the API calls are performed.
The contact ID corresponds to the sender, which needs to be a contact in the
GLS database. This determines the default return address, as well as the billing.
You can also configure the tracking url that is used for each carrier.
