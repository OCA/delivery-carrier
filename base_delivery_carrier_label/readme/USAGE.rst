** How does it works ? **


In picking UI a button "Send to shipper" trigger label generation
calling `send_to_shipper()` in models/stock.picking.py


** How to implement my own carrier ? **


Define a method `{carrier}_send_shipping()` which is called by _send_shipping native method.
Make it return a list of dict of this form :

.. code-block:: python

  {
      "exact_price": price,
      "tracking_number": 'number'
      "labels": [{
          "package_id": package_id,
          "name": filename,
          "datas": file_content (base64),
          "file_type": extension,
          "tracking_number": package_number
      }]
  }
