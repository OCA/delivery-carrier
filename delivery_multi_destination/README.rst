This module allows to set different price rules depending on the destination.

This module restores the concept of delivery grid, reusing the same model for
nesting several "children" delivery methods, one per possible destination.
It has been designed to reuse all possible extensions to the base delivery,
without the need to create a glue module for having multiple destinations.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

To configure delivery methods with multiple destinations:

#. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Delivery > Delivery Methods
#. Create or edit an existing record.
#. Select "Destination type" = "Multiple destinations".
#. Introduce a line for each destination in the new tab "Destinations"
#. Lines have priority, so you have to put first the lines with more restricted
   destinations.

Usage
=====

#. When using the delivery method in a Sales order, delivery address will be
   used for computing the delivery price according introduced destinations.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Delivery prices for e-commerce (`website_sale_delivery` module) might need
  an extra module for handling everything properly.
