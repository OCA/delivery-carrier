To configure delivery methods with multiple destinations:

#. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Delivery > Shipping Methods
#. Create or edit an existing record.
#. Select "Destination type" = "Multiple destinations".
#. Introduce a line for each destination in the new tab "Destinations"
#. Lines have priority, so you have to put first the lines with more restricted
   destinations.
