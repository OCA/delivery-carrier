This module allows to set different price rules depending on the destination.

This module restores the concept of delivery grid, reusing the same model for
nesting several "children" delivery methods, one per possible destination.
It has been designed to reuse all possible extensions to the base delivery,
without the need to create a glue module for having multiple destinations.
