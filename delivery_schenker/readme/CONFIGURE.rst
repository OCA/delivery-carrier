To configure a Schenker delivery method:

#. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Delivery > Shipping methods* and create a new one.
#. Choose *DB Schenker* as provider.
#. Configure the service parameters according to your contract considerations.
#. Choose a delivery product and a default packaging. This is mandatory for the booking
   request as it needs the packaging code.

To make tests, set the carrier environment to test from the smart button. Don't forget
to set it to production once you're ready to use the delivery method!
