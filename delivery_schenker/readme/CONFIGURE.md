To configure a Schenker delivery method:

1.  Go to *Inventory \> Configuration \> Delivery \> Shipping methods*
    and create a new one.
2.  Choose *DB Schenker* as provider.
3.  Configure the service parameters according to your contract
    considerations.
4.  Choose a delivery product and a default packaging. This is mandatory
    for the booking request as it needs the packaging code.

To make tests, set the carrier environment to test from the smart
button. Don't forget to set it to production once you're ready to use
the delivery method!
