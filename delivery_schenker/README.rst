This module links the `DB Schenker <https://www.dbschenker.com>`_ booking and tracking
APIs with Odoo delivery system.

**Table of contents**

Installation
============

This module depends on the `zeep` python library and the OCA/delivery-carrier
`delivery_package_number` and `delivery_state` modules.

The Schenker API doesn't provide delivery rating methods, so OCA's
`delivery_price_method` is advised in order to use this carrier in a sales workflow.

Configuration
=============

To configure a Schenker delivery method:

#. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Delivery > Shipping methods* and create a new one.
#. Choose *DB Schenker* as provider.
#. Configure the service parameters according to your contract considerations.
#. Choose a delivery product and a default packaging. This is mandatory for the booking
   request as it needs the packaging code.

To make tests, set the carrier environment to test from the smart button. Don't forget
to set it to production once you're ready to use the delivery method!

Usage
=====

These are the operations possible with this module:

Place shipping bookings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. When the picking is validated, the shipping will be booked at Schenker.
#. With the response, we'll receive the delivery tracking number and the pdf label in a
   chatter message and it will be kept as attachment to the document.
#. You can manage packages number either with the proper Odoo workflows or with the
   package number field available in the *Additional Info* tab. You'll get as many
   labels as declared packages.

Cancel bookings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. As in other carriers, we can cancel the shipping after the picking is done. To do
   so, go to *Additional Info* tab and click on the *Cancel* action on the side of the
   tracking number.
#. We can generate a new shipping if necessary.

Get labels
~~~~~~~~~~

#. If by chance we delete the generated labels, we can obtain them again hitting the
   *Schenker Label* buttons in the header of the picking form.

Tracking
~~~~~~~~

#. The module is integrated with `delivery_state` to be able to get the tracking info
   directly from the DB Schenker API.
#. To do so, go to a picking shipped with Schenker. In the *Additional Info* tab you'll
   find an action button to *Update tracking state* so the state will be updated from
   the Schenker API.

Debugging
~~~~~~~~~

The API calls and responses are tracked in two special fields in the picking that can
be viewed by technical users. You can also log them in as `ir.logging` records setting
the carrier debug on from the smart button.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* There's no dummy access key to test API calls so no tests can be performed.
* The test booking and shipping APIs databases aren't connected so it isn't possible to
  perform trackings on test mode.
* Only land shipping is implemented, although the module is prepared for extend to
  air and ocean just considering the mandatory request fields for those methods.
  Some additional adaptations could be needed (e.g.: origin and destination airport,
  port) anyway.
* Only volume is supported as a measure unit and with the limitations of Odoo itself. To
  enjoy a full fledged volume support, install and configure the OCA’s
  `stock_quant_package_dimension` module and its dependencies. The connector is ready to
  make use of their volume computations.
* It’d be needed to extend the method to support Schenker measure units such as  loading
  pieces or pallet space.
* Some more booking features aren’t yet supported although can be extended in the
  future. Some of those, although the complete list would be really extensive:

  * Dangerous goods.
  * Driver pre-advise.
  * Transport temperature.
  * Customs clearance.
  * Cargo insurance.
  * Cash on delivery.
