Installation
============

As a requirement you need to install `suds-jurko` library. It will fail with the
latest and outdated version of `suds`.
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/suds-jurko/0.6


Furthermore, if you want to use the integration server of Postlogistics
you will have to patch this library with the following patch:

https://fedorahosted.org/suds/attachment/ticket/239/suds_recursion.patch

A copy of this patch is available in `patches` folder of this module.

Configuration
=============

.. important::
   A "Swiss Post Business customer" account is required to use this module.

   See `Log in`_


To configure:

* Go to `Inventory -> Configuration -> Delivery -> Shipping Methods`
* Create new shipping methods for postlogistics and set your login informations
* launch the Update PostLogistics Services

This will load available services and generate carrier options.

Now you can create a carrier method for PostLogistics WebService:

* First choose a Service group and save
* Add a Mandatory Carrier option using a Basic Service
* Save Carrier Method (this will update filters to show you only
  compatible services)
* Then add other `Optional as default` and `Optional` carrier option
  from listed
* Add additional Service and Delivery instructions

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Integration of price webservice :
  https://www.post.ch/en/customer-center/all-online-services/preise-berechnen/info

* Not sure if the recursive patch of suds is still needed as there's no need
  to use the integration WS anymore. However we still want to patch open to
  get meaningful error messages.
