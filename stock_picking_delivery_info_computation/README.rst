This module extends the functionality of delivery to support
calculating the picking weight giving priority to the package operations and
also allowing you to calculate volume manually with same logic.

On a picking which only has inital demand, calculation will be as standard,
based on the picking lines product quantity.

As soon as you have any reserved quantity, it will only take them into account.
In this case, the computation of the weight and volume is based in *to do*
quantities, unles you introduce anything in *done* quantity, switching to this
column in that case.

The volume is auto-computed when the picking is generated from a sales order,
or a backorder is created from original picking, but remains editable for any
possible manual edition.

You also have a button available for recomputing volume with current data.

#. Go to *Inventory > Operations > Transfers* and
   pick one not in state *Done* or *Cancelled*.
#. Click on tab *Additional Info* and click on button
   *Re-calculate Volume*

If only has Inital demand volume will be based on the move
lines product *Volume* and *Quantity* but if has *Operations*
only will take in count with two possibilities:

#. If none operation has *Done* then Volume is calculate
   as the sum of operation lines *To Do* quantity.
#. As soon any operation line has total of partial *Done*
   quantity only these product volume will be as the
   picking volume.

Weight is always calculate automatic following the standard
but Volume need to click the button to refresh.
