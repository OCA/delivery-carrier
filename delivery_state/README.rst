This module adds additional functions that will be needed for the
carrier developments. It provides fields to be able to contemplate the
tracking states and also adds a global field so it can have generic
states in addition to the ones carrier gives us.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

A scheduled action for automating the tracking update for these pickings
can be configured going to *Settings > Technical > Scheduled Actions*
and then choosing *Update deliveries states*. It will update the pending
delivery states for the pickings with service providers with tracking
methods configured, and in pending state (not delivered or cancelled).

In order to send automatic notifications to the customer when the
picking is customer_delivered:

   1. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Settings*.
   2. Enable the option *Email Confirmation (customer delivered)*.
   3. Choose the template "Delivery: Picking delivered by Email".

Usage
=====

Depending on the delivery service provider, the state tracking could be
more or less complete, since it could have or not the necessary API
calls implemented.

With regular methods (fixed, based on rules):

   1. Go to Inventory / Operations and open an outgoing pending picking.
   2. In the *Additional Info* tab, assign it a delivery carrier which
      is fixed or based on rules.
   3. Validate the picking and you'll see in the same tab the delivery
      state info with the shipping date and the shipping state.
   4. If enabled, an automatic notification will be sent to the picking
      customer.

When service provider methods are implemented, we can follow the same
steps as described before, but we'll get additionally:

   1. In the *Additional Info* tab, we'll see button *Update tracking
      state* to manually query the provider API for tracking updates for
      this expedition.

   2. Depending on the stated returned by the provider, we could get
      these states (field *Carrier State*):

         -  Shipping recorded in carrier
         -  In transit
         -  Canceled shipment (finished)
         -  Incident
         -  Warehouse delivered
         -  Customer delivered (finished)

   3. In the field *Tracking state* we'll get the tracking state name
      given by the provider (which is mapped to the ones in this module)

   4. In the field *Tracking history* we'll get the former states log.
