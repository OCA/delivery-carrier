This module needs package in order to work.
To generate the carrier labels on the picking, each products need to be assigned to a destination package. In case you don't want to bother with the use of package because the whole content of the picking usually fit in a unique package, you may consider installing the module delivery_automatic_package from the same repository (delivery-carrier). The package will be assigned automatically when asking the carrier labels.
