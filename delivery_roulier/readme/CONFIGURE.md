This module needs package in order to work. To generate the carrier
labels on the picking, each products need to be assigned to a
destination package. In case you don't want to bother with the use of
package because the whole content of the picking usually fit in a unique
package, you may consider installing the module
delivery_automatic_package from the same repository (delivery-carrier).
The package will be assigned automatically when asking the carrier
labels.
