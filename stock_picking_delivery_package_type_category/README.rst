Use Cases / Context
===================

BUSINESS NEED:

-  Users doing the delivery are often different ones as users doing the
   picking.
-  Delivery pickings would be able to know what kind of packages they
   will be able to manipulate. This concept was introduced in
   stock_package_type_category module.
-  As delivery packages will be categorized, but maybe using the same
   carrier specifications, we need to filter package types by category
   in put in pack operation.

APPROACH:

-  'Authorized' package type categories will be set on the operation
   types (typically picking or packing ones).

Configuration
=============

-  Go to Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Operation
   Types
-  Go to Packages section and add the package type categories you want
   in 'Authorized Package Type Categories' field.

Usage
=====

After having configured the desired operation types, during picking
operations, when doing the 'Put In Pack' operation, you can only select
package type categories you configured.
