Integrate CBL file generation in Odoo. As of the creation of this module, this carrier's services are available in
Spain and Portugal. It covers the 3rd section of the attached documentation.

Instead of working with a Web Service, this module generates the file necessary to create the CBL shipment.
As stated in the documentation, they do not offer a Web Service, but they offer to install a light software
that can be used to create the shipment with the generated file.

This would be configured to download the file to that folder and have the software vaccuum it up
to create the shipment.

If later CBL offers a web service to create shipments, this module would be modified to adapt to it. Perhaps with a toggle if
the user wants to use the web service or not, depending on how the web service works.
