This module recovers the number of packages field that was present in previous
versions of Odoo, that can be either be set manually by the user, but also allows
to be computed when the delivery packages flow is used.

This field can be used by delivery carrier extensions that need such info to
rate the shipment, print the labels, etc.

Usage
=====

If no delivery packages are used:

#. Go to an open picking and click in the *Additional Info* tab.
#. In the *Delivey Information* section you'll find a **Number of packages**
   field that you can edit.

If delivey packages are used:

#. The field will be recomputed depending on the delivery packages used in the
   picking although can be edited at convenience later.

When the picking is confirmed, the user has the chance to change the number of
packages in the confirmation wizard.
