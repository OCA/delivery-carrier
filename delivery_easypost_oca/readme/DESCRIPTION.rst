This module adds `Easpost <https://easypost.com>`_ to the available carriers.

It allows you to register shippings, generate labels, get rates from order so no need of exchanging
any kind of file.

When a sales order is created in Odoo and the EasyPost carrier is assigned, the shipping price
will be automatically calculated using the lowest estimated rate from EasyPost,
based on the order information, including the shipping address and products.
