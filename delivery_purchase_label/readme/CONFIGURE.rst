On the partner form a new field `Purchase Delivery Method` allows to select
the carrier that will be used by the supplier to send the goods.

In "Inventory > Configuration > Delivery > Shipping Methods", a new field
`Operation Type for Sending Labels`
allows to select the operation type to use for the stock transfer that will
generate the required labels.
If that field is not set, there will be no changes to the normal flow.
