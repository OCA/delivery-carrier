To use this module, you need to:

1.  Go to *Purchase \> Orders \> Purchase Orders* and create a new
    Purchase Order.
2.  Select a carrier in the field 'Delivery Method', fill out the rest
    of the form, be sure you added lines with storable products and save
    the form.
3.  Confirm the purchase order.
4.  Go to the linked 'Receipt' by clicking on 'Receipt' smart-button and
    you will see, under 'Additional info' tab, the same carrier selected
    in the purchase order.
5.  If necessary, you can change the carrier in the 'Receipt'. When it
    is validated, the 'shipping cost' of the receipt will be calculated
    according to that new selected Carrier.
6.  It is possible to change the shipping cost in picking.
7.  The shipping cost will appear in an internal note created
    automatically when the 'Receipt' is validated.
