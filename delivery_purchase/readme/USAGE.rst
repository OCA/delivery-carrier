To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Purchase > Orders > Purchase Orders* and create a new Purchase Order.
#. Select a carrier in the field 'Delivery Method', fill out the rest
   of the form, be sure you added lines with storable products
   and save the form.
#. Confirm the purchase order.
#. Go to the linked 'Receipt' by clicking on 'Receipt' smart-button and
   you will see, under 'Additional info' tab, the same carrier selected
   in the purchase order.
#. If necessary, you can change the carrier in the 'Receipt'. When
   it is validated, the 'shipping cost' of the receipt will be
   calculated according to that new selected Carrier.
#. The shipping cost will appear in an internal note created
   automatically when the 'Receipt' is validated.
