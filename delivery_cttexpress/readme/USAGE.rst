The shipping codes are generated when a stock picking which carrier is configured
for CTT Express as a provider is validated. The label is generated and attached to
the document according to the label generation parameters configured before.

In case you accidentally delete the label attachment, you can generate it again clicking
on the *CTT Express Label* button on the top of the picking form.

As usual, to cancel the shipping, go to the *Additional Information* tab and click on
the *Cancel delivery* action next to the *Shipping code* field.

To print the shippings manifest between dates, go to:

#. *Inventory > Reports > CTT Express Manifest*
#. In the wizard we can configure the document format (Excel or PDF) and the date to
   comprehend.
#. We can filter delivery methods as well in case we handle different CTT accounts.
#. Click on *Get Manifest* to gather the requested files.

To make an scheduled shippings pickup request:

#. Go to the shipping method for which account we want to schedule the pickup and click
   on the *Pickup request* button.
#. In the wizard, select the date and the minimum and maximum pickup hour.
#. After clicking on the *Request pickup* button you'll get a pickup request code that
   you should keep in case there's any issue with it.
