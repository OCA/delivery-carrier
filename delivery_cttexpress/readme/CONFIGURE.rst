CTT Express Iberic Web Services API doesn't provide shipping price calculation methods.
So you'll have to rely on Odoo standard methods selecting them in the field
*Price method*.

To configure your CTT Express services, go to:

#. *Inventory/Sales > Configuration > Delivery methods* and create a new one.
#. Choose *CTT Express* as provider.
#. Configure your CTT credentials: contract, agency, customer code, user and password.
#. Configure your label format:

   - Single: Thermal printer (single label).
   - MULTI1: One label per sheet.
   - MULTI3: Protrait 3 labels per sheet.
   - MULTI4: Landscape 4 labels per sheet.
#. You can also can configure your printer offset.
#. Choose you shipping service.

If you wish to configure several services with the same credentials, duplicate the first
you made and change the service in the copy.
