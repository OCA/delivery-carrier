When creating or editing an order we go to the Other information section and in Shipping Information we can define Carrier notes, for example: Deliver from 08:00, if there is no one to leave the neighbor.

This data is transferred to the stock_picking linked to the orders (read only) to be used with carrier integrations (and to send that information).
