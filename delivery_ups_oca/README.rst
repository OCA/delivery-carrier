This module adds `UPS <https://ups.com>`_ to the available carriers.

It allows you to register shippings, generate labels, get rates from order, read
shipping states and cancel shipments using UPS webservice, so no need of exchanging
any kind of file.

When a sales order is created in Odoo and the UPS carrier is assigned, the shipping
price that will be obtained will be the price that the UPS webservice estimates
according to the order information (address and products).

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Add a carrier account with delivery type ``ups`` and fill in your credentials
#. Configure in Odoo all required fields of the UPS tab with your account data https://wwwapps.ups.com/ppc/ppc.html (Username WS , Password WS, Access license number, Shipper number, etc)
#. If yo have "Tracking state update sync" checked all delivery orders state check will be done querying UPS services.

**NOTE** You need to request an access key from https://www.ups.com/upsdeveloperkit/manageaccesskeys?loc=es_ES
for using the webservice.

Usage
=====

You have to set the created shipping method in the delivery order to ship:

* When the picking is 'Transferred', a *Create Shipping Label* button appears. Just click on it, and if all went well, the label will be 'attached'.
* If the shipment creation process fails, a validation error will appear displaying UPS error.
* When the delivery order is cancelled, it's automatically cancelled too in UPS.
* If you have "Tracking state update sync" checked in the shipping method, a periodical state check will be done querying UPS services.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Support international forms
* Support package service options
