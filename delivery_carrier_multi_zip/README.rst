This module allows to set more than one interval of zip codes for matching each
shipping method.

Installation
============

This module generates the initial ZIP interval entry from existing "ZIP from"
and "ZIP to", filling one of the two interval parts with wildcard strings.

Configuration
=============

To configure delivery methods with multiple ZIPs:

#. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Delivery > Shipping Methods
#. Create or edit an existing record.
#. Introduce a line for each interval of zip codes.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- There's some code for proxying the standard values to the new intervals, for
  covering cases like automatisms or other modules that touch such fields, but
  there are still non covered cases like multiple consecutive writings creating
  weird ZIP interval tables.
